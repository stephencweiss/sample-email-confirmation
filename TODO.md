Ways I want to extend this application
- [ ] Actually _deliver_ emails (currently logging url to email captured by ethreal)
- [ ] move the email sending from gmail to amazon SNS (SQS) - https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc
(take a look at begin.com?)
- [ ] deploy via netlify
- [x] hosted db - mongodb
- [ ] form validation on email
- [ ] convert to graphql
- [ ] refactor controller to state machine
